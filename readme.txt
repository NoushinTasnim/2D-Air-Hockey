<h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
+ Players cannot move into each other's half of the table or beyond the table's boundary.
+ The objective is to score goals by hitting the ball into the opponent's goalpost.
+ Each goal increases the scoring player's score by 1.
+ After a goal, the ball is reset to the center of the table.

<h3>Development</h3>
This game was developed using Python and OpenGL. It showcases basic graphics and game development concepts, including:
+ 2D rendering with OpenGL.
+ Keyboard input handling.
+ Collision detection.
+ Score tracking.
